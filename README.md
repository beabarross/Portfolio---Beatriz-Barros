# Portfolio---Beatriz-Barros

ðŸ‘€ This repository contains my personal portfolio project, showcasing my journey in front-end development and design. It focuses on creating a visually engaging and user-centered portfolio that reflects my skills and creativity. The project started from the ground up, driven by my passion for design and functionality. You'll also find updates and insights documented through Figma and Notion, where I keep a detailed log of the progress and decisions made during the creation process. Explore and follow along as the project evolves!
